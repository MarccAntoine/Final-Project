# <span style="color: #117CD9"> FoodFlow (Final Project) - Marc-Antoine Tremblay </span>

This website was created as my 5th and last project in the Concordia Bootcamp. The goal of the project is to showcase my web development skills using all notions learned during the course. I am using the following languages and librairies to build this project; HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, NodeJs and MongoDb. This project originaly started with a white page and gradually transformed into a full website containing multiple pages, a server and a database. 

## ‚úèÔ∏è The Front End

I built the user-interface and experience using Figma and multiple online ressources for fonts and colors such as Adobe Color and Google Fonts. I kept a simple and minimal design to make the experience easy and simple to navigate. 

The website has been built keeping accessibility in mind, it is possible to navigate through keyboard navigation using the Tab key and, sometimes Arrow up and Arrow down to select elements in a list. All inputs have labels accessible to screen-readers and aria-labels are used on logo buttons. 

I built a complete front-end containing multiple pages with the React-Router-dom from React. Additional React hooks were used to make the website interactive and efficient like useState, useEffect, useContext and useNavigate. An example of the use of the useContext hook use was to make the user's information, particulary his stocks, available through the whole app while reducing the time and efforts to access those frequently used informations.

 ## üîú Future of my project

 I have some plans to update my portfolio when I will graduate from the bootcamp. First, I will add a backend servers for the data manipulation and make it possible to send an email to my email address with the already created form. I will also change the showcased projects with the next projects I develop in the bootcamp or personal projects. I plan on changing the visual of that section as I am hesitant about how it looks.
